# Git Remote Repository Initialization

## Scenario 1: New Repository with No Existing Code on GitHub

If the GitHub repository is empty (no code or commits yet), and you already have code in your local project, you do not need to pull. You can simply push your local changes.

```bash
git init

git add.
git commit -m "Initial Commit"

git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repo_name

git push -u origin main
```

## Scenario 2: Repository on GitHub Already Has Code or Files

If the GitHub repository already has commits or files (like a `README.md` or a `.gitignore`), and your local repository also has commits, you should pull first to avoid conflicts when pushing.

```bash
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repo_name
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

git add .
git commit -m "Merge changes"

git push -u origin main
```

### Summary

- **If your GitHub repo is empty**: No need to pull; just push your local commits.
- **If your GitHub repo already has files or commits**: Pull first to synchronize changes, then push.
